# Redacted-Public-Release-ATHIIA-Build-4-Sep-2019
Repository containing the CIF submission for A Telehealth Hub Initiative and Interfacility Access - WebVRAM, build 4 received Sep 2019.

The Community Care Contact Center (C4) currently manages customer contacts from Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) employees, Veterans, and community care providers in response to health care services. To manage current workload, C4 staff requires access to multiple VistA and FBCS systems, managing over 60 access and verify codes to support just six Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN). With enterprise-wide expansion (roll out seven [7] additional VISNs in Fiscal Year [FY] 2018; remaining VISNs early FY 2019), future workload would increase access and verify codes to 140 instances. To eliminate this problem, C4 staff will need access to FBCS and VistA at all sites via single log-in, which will negate the need to sign-in to each individual site.
